# Etch-A-Sketch

This application mimics an old Etch-A-Sketch toy. It is created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

The project is based on the assignment in [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Web Dev 101 curriculum, and is meant to put to use the skills picked up in the DOM manipulation section of the course, plus all of the HTML and CSS fundamentals covered earlier in the curriculum. [The assignment deails can be found here.](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project?ref=lnav#assignment)
